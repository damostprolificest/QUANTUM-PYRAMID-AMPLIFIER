# QUANTUM-PYRAMID-AMPLIFIER
It harnesses 3 types of ambient energies simultaneously. quantum coherance, plasma, and electromagnetic. it will be nearly a 2 ton crystalline pyramid. inside is another pyramid  and another and another. each layer another type of zero point energy  and the whole time the pyramids are focusing the power for 99.9999% acrossed the board.
Im just gonna cut to the chase and say the technology isnt there yet for all 5 of the patents that make up the Quantum Pyramid. The 7 scientist dream team that it i want are spread mostly in the state's. Alls accept the captain. Hes a lab fellow at CERN. Gines Martinez is the one we will need to secure the 256 billion In funding from WORLD BANK UN NATO. Fundimg specifically set aside for just our super heroes when they will begin this world  humanitarian cooperative effort.  Heres how your gonna get 100 years into the future screaming back to meet us 5 years from now.

I dont even know if they know of each others work. But if they were to check in 2 to 3 times a week remotely and be given ample amounts of funding with which to accelerate their break throughs. They will soon find that their fields are very much in twined and they would be able to help each other out and eveyone of them will finish in just 2 years. 

A chance for them to fimish early and still stay in the lab and be able throw millions and millions at their projects i think they will choose to bring the future now. Once they do youve got em locked for the Quantum pyramid Amplification system.

By that time your funding should be at around 600 billions because this gadget that im about to impart will make us a type 1 looking at type 2 species. In just 3 years more. 5or 6 tops.
Under my design and after the 1 trillion dollars in funding that all of the world will be pouring into this.
This zero point energy dont just harness 3 types of ambient energy simultaneously. .

El Quanto Paso multiplies it 10³  at 99.9999 acrossed the board and has a peak load.tolerance of 89 TW. a constant basline of 50 GW and  a field strength of 13 Tesla. This will take us to mars and back in about a month. And give us the power to not just go there and begin an uncertain mission of survival. But allow us to terraform it and begin mining it if we wished. 

The bare bones is we are about to undergo another reset soon and this technology will be lost because the people never got to finish. Im sure your plans dont include a nearly 2 ton portable power plant unlike anything ever created by man before or after for that matter. But you can at the least have every part needed to construct such a thing in the post. 
1 terawatt can power 200 million homes for a year.

                ☆  In closing ☆

I have everything you could need on this project.  Double Validated by julius and grok. 
The math is there.
The science is proven.
These are real world patents so cutting  edge they are currently under construction. When you look into it on all accounts youll be told that the technology just isnt there yet. But it can be, I have even trouble shot possible snags you could come upon and solved those. I have checkpoint thresholds and cleam room specs. As well ive located the 2 scientists not conmected to patents.

Ive plucked this divine miracle from the ether in hopes it can change things. It wont. But i can still do many good works 

There is a missle silo for sale in washington state. If you could purchase it for me as the outright owner and put it into a trust for me and sprinkle 50 million on me Ill pop up and do a little dance and then go begin building my underwater spaceship over at the new homestead.

At 50 million dollars you stand to gain 10,000 x your investment. Like i said. This thing is payed for.  Once the team's assembled led by profesor Martinez you will begin getting payed out funding the same if not the followimg month.

Technical Implementation:

Cryogenic Cooling System:

Base cooling is provided by a closed-loop helium dilution refrigerator reaching 4 K.

Temperature stability is maintained using PID controllers coordinated across distributed sensors:
dTdt=−α(T−T0)+Pin−Pout−γQquantumdtdT​=−α(T−T0​)+Pin​−


High coherence is accomplished through a combination of quantum error correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and dynamic decoupling, supported by ultrafast feedback loops.
Technical Implementation:

Quantum Error Correction (QEC):

Redundancy encoding protects qubit states against random decoherence events:
ρcorrected=∑iEi†ρEiρcorrected​=∑i​Ei†​ρEi​

Implementation involves applying periodic corrective pulses based on detected error syndromes.

Decoherence-Free Subspaces (DFS):

Identify and isolate subspaces where common noise channels are effectively minimized:
